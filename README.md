LaravelSanctumKit

Since Laravel version 11, Laravel is officialy not release with the API routes. You are wasting much time for laravel API configuration based on laravel, If you are using Laravel as a API powered backend app instead of the full-stack web app with blade or any frontend technologies that support for laravel.

Why,
You need to install manually install laravel api for get the sanctum and laravel api routes and some configuration changes related with API base development.

and also, if you are using laravel just for API base development you no longer need web routes and some configuration related with the file. Because, that unwanted code and file will mess your laravel app.
